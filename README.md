Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis & Dashboard
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow—from loading and exploring a dataset in Python, to data cleaning and SQL analysis, and finally building an interactive dashboard in Power BI.
It showcases my skills in data ingestion, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL querying, visualization, and presenting business insights.

📂 Dataset

Source: (Add dataset link or describe origin – e.g., Kaggle, internal, synthetic, etc.)

Format: CSV

Description: Contains information related to (briefly describe the topic, e.g., sales transactions, customer behavior, performance metrics).

Key Features: (List 4–6 important columns, e.g., Date, Product, Sales, CustomerID, Region, Category)

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

MySQL Server (SQL queries and data validation)

Power BI Desktop (interactive dashboard)

Git/GitHub (version control)

🚀 Project Steps
1. Data Loading

Imported the dataset using Python (Pandas).

Checked the structure, data types, and initial statistics.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed descriptive statistics.

Identified trends, patterns, correlations, and outliers.

Visualized data using plots (distribution, relationships, time-series, etc.).

3. Data Cleaning

Handled missing values (imputation or removal).

Corrected inconsistencies in text and categorical fields.

Removed duplicates.

Converted data types (dates, numeric columns).

Created new calculated fields to support deeper analysis.

4. SQL Analysis (MySQL)

Uploaded the cleaned dataset into MySQL server tables.

Ran SQL queries such as:

Filtering and grouping data

Aggregate calculations

Joins for enriched insights

Trend and performance analysis

Validated Python findings with SQL results.

5. Power BI Dashboard

Imported cleaned dataset into Power BI.

Built interactive visuals such as:

KPI cards

Bar and line charts

Heatmaps / category breakdown

Filters and slicers

Designed a user-friendly dashboard that highlights the key insights from the data.

📊 Dashboard

The final Power BI dashboard provides a clear overview of:

Key performance indicators (KPIs)

Top categories / products / segments

Trends over time

Regional or demographic breakdowns

Data quality insights

(Add screenshot or link if available.)

📈 Results & Insights

Some of the insights uncovered include:

(Insight #1 — e.g., Sales increased by 18% in Q4 compared to Q3.)

(Insight #2 — e.g., Category X contributes the highest revenue.)

(Insight #3 — e.g., Customer churn is highest in Region Y.)

(Insight #4 — e.g., Common issues affecting data quality.)

These results helped identify improvement opportunities and strategic focus areas for decision-making.

▶️ How to Run This Project
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

2. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run Python Scripts / Notebook

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook


Or run the script:

python main.py

4. Load SQL Data (Optional)

Import the SQL script (.sql file) into your MySQL server.

Ensure your MySQL connection settings match those in the Python script.

5. Open the Power BI Dashboard

Open Dashboard.pbix using Power BI Desktop.

Refresh the dataset if needed.
